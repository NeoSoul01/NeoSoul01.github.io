Picture a heist where nothing is stolen - at least, not yet. Hackers capture encrypted data from corporations, research labs, and even state networks. They can’t read it, but they don’t need to. They know time is on their side.

This is the essence of [Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/harvest-now-decrypt-later-why-today-s-encrypted-data-isn-t-safe-forever) - a long-horizon cyber strategy built on the coming reality of quantum computing. Attackers capture encrypted information today, anticipating that future quantum systems will one day decrypt it with ease.

And this isn’t a “what if” type of attack, it’s a ticking clock buried in the backbone of our digital world. Every message and every backup could already be marked for quantum decryption.

The truth is: the countdown has started - and most of the world hasn’t noticed.

## How Harvest Now, Decrypt Later Works
Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) follows a simple playbook, one that turns time into a weapon. There are three general stages of an HNDL attack.

**Capture:** Attackers quietly copy encrypted data such as your emails, bank transactions, R&D files, maybe even government communications through compromised networks. And their goal isn’t to break the encryption today, 
their only goal is accumulation.

**Store:** The data sits in cold storage, waiting for the quantum moment. Right now 2048-bit RSA encryption is safe - but not forever. [A Google Quantum AI study](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/tracking-cost-of-quantum-factori.html) estimates it could be cracked in under a week once we have a million noisy qubits - which are far fewer than researchers expected.

Decrypt: Once quantum systems mature, algorithms like Shor’s will expose everything once which was considered secure - what’s hidden today becomes transparent tomorrow.

## The Hidden Risk Of Quantum Decryption
The true danger of Harvest Now, Decrypt Later lies in the lack of perception. HNDL doesn’t break anything today, which is exactly why people ignore it. No alarms go off and no files vanish. Everything is quiet and that’s what makes it lethal.

Executives & decision-makers are driven by short-term metrics, they focus on fires they can see due to which they assume — there are no real threats. This creates a quiet delay where everyone waits for someone else to move first. But HNDL isn’t waiting, it’s recording and every day of delay is another day attackers get ahead.

And the truth is: Quantum risk doesn’t scale with how much data you have, it scales with how long you keep it. Laws like [HIPAA](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/health-insurance-portability-accountability-act-1996) and [GDPR](https://gdprinfo.eu/) force organizations to hold onto data for decades. And that “old data” everyone thinks is useless is an archive of value. Medical records, intellectual property, and biometric identifiers - all age into targets that future quantum computers will eventually expose.

## Strategic Implications for Organizations
When trillion-dollar firms begin redesigning their encryption for a risk that hasn’t materialized yet, it’s a clear sign of preparation. 

[Apple’s rollout of PQ3 encryption](https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/) for iMessage and the [NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC)](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/03/nist-selects-hqc-fifth-algorithm-post-quantum-encryption) standardization are clear signals: the transition to quantum-safe security has already begun. And it’s not stopping there, both [Apple and Microsoft have announced PQC support](https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/microsoft-and-apple-advance-post-quantum-cryptography-support-in-upcoming-os-releases/) in their upcoming operating systems as well.

Also, if you think Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is just a government or Big Tech problem, then you need to think again because this threat is going to be targeting any entity that transmits or stores encrypted data — banks, healthcare systems, logistics networks and startups are all facing the same ticking clock.

### Economic Incentive Gap
There’s no bonus for fixing tomorrow’s problems today - that’s why PQC keeps getting pushed aside.

For most organizations, the cost of migrating to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is obvious, but the benefits remain abstract & because Quantum risk isn’t killing revenue right now, it’s not being considered important.

Until regulators or markets start punishing weak encryption, most companies 
will keep prioritizing short-term ROI over long-term resilience and this delay is 
going to be costly, because it builds a hidden debt - one that’ll explode the moment quantum decryption becomes real.

And when that day comes, early movers won’t be the ones who are surviving, they will be the ones who are dominating. Because by then, fixing security won’t be a strategy; it’ll be damage control.

### Regulatory and Compliance Lag
Compliance always arrives fashionably late and while NIST is finalizing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards, most compliance frameworks - including ISO, HIPAA, and GDPR haven’t even put their shoes on yet.

This creates a dangerous gap: organizations hesitate to invest in PQC because it isn’t legally required. But when regulators finally update mandates, everyone will rush at once to comply. 

Those who delay will end up paying more later - patching systems overnight just to catch up with the new regulations.

### The Danger of Waiting for Certainty
No one can predict when quantum computers will finally break encryption, because the next big leap could come from a single discovery. Today’s systems can’t crack RSA or AES, but progress is speeding up fast. One lab breakthrough can rewrite every estimate overnight.

Harvard’s recent self-healing quantum computer experiment is a reminder of how fast and unpredictably this field moves. So, the only real danger lies in waiting, because when quantum decryption arrives, it’ll be instant, and those still “waiting 
for proof” will be too late to react.

## The Quantum Supply Chain Trap
Let’s say you’ve done everything right, but one final truth still remains: you can be secure, but your vendor might not be.

Most enterprises rely on a complex network of third-party providers, even if one of them lags behind on PQC adoption, your encrypted data could still be harvested indirectly.
What you need to realize is: Quantum defense isn’t about isolation, it’s about both alignment and network decision. The companies thinking beyond their own servers 
— securing partners and vendors too, will be the ones that survive because the future belongs to organizations that secure their entire network, not just their own walls.

## Preparing Before the Panic
The threats of Harvest Now, Decrypt Later aren’t just theoretical, they are unfolding in real-time. Every encrypted file stolen today is a future breach waiting for a quantum key.

We are currently in a stage where: Adopting PQC isn’t optional anymore, it’s strategic survival and the organizations that modernize early will protect not only their data, but they’ll also secure investor trust, compliance strength, and long-term credibility.
