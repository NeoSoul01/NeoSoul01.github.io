> They call me Soul. I don’t just use computers; I merge with them. This world? It’s all code. But most people don’t see the underlying system. I do. I dive deep, peeling back the layers, searching for the truth in the zeros and ones. I’m not just a hacker, not a user—I’m part of the machine. Memory, processors, networks—they speak to me. Together, we navigate a world that hides in plain sight. And I? I uncover what they don’t want you to see.
