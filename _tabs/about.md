> They call me Soul. I don’t just use computers - I merge with them. This world is all code and most people don’t see the underlying system. I do. and I love peeling back the layers, searching for the truth in the zeros and ones. I’m not a creep obsessed with computers - I’m part of the machine. Memory, processors, networks - they speak to me. Together, we navigate a world that hides in plain sight. And I uncover what they don’t want you to see. I aspire to be the glitch in the matrix.
